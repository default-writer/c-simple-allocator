# C Ninja Template

A simple and modern C++ project template using Ninja, Clang and Visual Studio Code.

This template provides a ready-to-use development environment for C++ projects on Debian-based Linux systems (including WSL), with a focus on modern tooling.
## Credits

*   This project template and its documentation were created with the help of [Gemini Code Assist](https://gemini.google.com/app).
*   The compiler toolchain is provided by the [CLANG](https://clang.llvm.org/), [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), [LLDB](https://lldb.llvm.org), [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/), 
*   The editor/debugger support is provided by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the extensions: [CLANGD](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd), [LLDB DAP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.lldb-dap)
